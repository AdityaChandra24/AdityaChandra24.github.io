                    Millie Bobby Brown (born 19 February 2004) is a British actress and model.[1][2][3] In 2018, Brown
                    was featured in the Time 100 list of the world's most influential people,[4] and was appointed as a
                    UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador, the then youngest person selected for this position.[5]

                    Following a series of guest roles on television, Brown achieved acclaim for her role as Eleven in
                    the Netflix sci-fi drama series Stranger Things (2016â€“present), which earned her two Primetime Emmy
                    Award nominations for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series, and two Screen Actors Guild
                    Award nominations for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Drama Series. She is one of the
                    youngest nominees for the award.[6]

                    Brown made her feature debut with a lead role in the monster film Godzilla: King of the Monsters
                    (2019), a character she reprised in the sequel Godzilla vs. Kong (2021). She also starred in and
                    produced the Netflix mystery film Enola Holmes (2020).
